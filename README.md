# Personal CV with commits tree!

Hello and welcome! First of all, I'd like to ask you to check the end result here to understand what I'm talking about.
[demo](https://tarekjellali.com/)

## What is this?

This is a personal webpage inspired from a CV template I've conceived. It's all inspired from git where you'll see a section with a Readme.md and a commits tree.

You may then ask "Why not just any generic template?". Well first of all because it would be a shame for a Frontend Web developer to use a template (especially that it's about showcasing his talent). But also because I got pretty bored of all those CV templates that are just a copy of a copy.

## But why this? Why a commit tree?

Why not? As a programmer, a git tree represents well our evolution, I really think it's the best way to show off complex path. Also, it will show that you master the art of git *(even though honestly, I still don't get a lot of things about it)*.

## Can I use this?

Of course! This work is under [CC-BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/) licence.

## I see no framework over here!

That's because I've used none of 'em! All this is pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. That's what makes it even awesome.

The mobile version is the biggest challenge and I can really say that I'm proud of it.

## Usage
1. Clone this project.
2. Replace all the content (make sure to respect the markup).
3. Upload and enjoy!

## Why did you not use at least gulp for some minification?

I made this in almost 3 days. I didn't want to add tooling because it will just be a waste of time (and I'll start procrastinating) so I just made all this, put it on my VPS, pointed the domain and put it behind CloudFlare to minify everything automatically.

## How does the commit tree work?

If you inspect the code, you'll just see ul elements containing li elements and other nested ul elements. That's it! Everything is static and is based on uls. Awesome isn't it?
